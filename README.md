# Sentence-Vectorizer
A simple package that given a list of sentences converts each of them to a vector.

This package can be used for the following purposes:

1. Convert any given sentence into a `bag of words` using operations from nltk python library.
2. Using a TF-IDF conversion method, conversion of a bag of words to a vector

Using the vector from the TF-IDF, one can easily plug into any NN as they work on vectors.
